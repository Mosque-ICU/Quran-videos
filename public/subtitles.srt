1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,313
In the name of Allah, the Entirely, Merciful, the Especially Merciful.

2
00:00:08,428 --> 00:00:12,408
All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds.

3
00:00:12,080  --> 00:00:17,886
The Entirely Merciful, the Especially Merciful. 

4
00:00:18,886 --> 00:00:21,639
Sovereign of the day of recompense.

5
00:00:23,366 --> 00:00:26,450
It is you we worship and you we ask for help. 

6
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:30,710
Guide us to the straight path.

7
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:39,999
The path of those upon whom you have bestowed favour, not of those who have evoked your anger, or of those who are astray.
